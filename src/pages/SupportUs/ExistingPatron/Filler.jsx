                    The Museum is a charity and the vital donations made by our Patrons go towards supporting the Museum across many different areas and making sure that we are able to remain accessible and open to public audiences from across the world. This can include contributing to the care, preservation and display of the collection, as well as enabling the Museum to invest in ground-breaking research, whether in the laboratory in Bloomsbury or an archaeological excavation in Iraq. The British Museum and its rich collection tell the story of our shared humanity and we thank you for supporting us in stewarding this history for future generations.
